# Kickstarting with Excel
    Analysis of Kickstarting based on Launch Date and Goals
## Overview of Project
    An analysis on how different fundraising campaigns did based on their launch dates and their funding goals. We used the kickstart dataset to make a chart on the Outcomes based on Launch Date and a chart on The Outcomes Based on Goals.
### Purpose
    The Purpose of this analysis is to find out how the fundraising campaigns for Theater did based upon their fundraising launch date and how they did based on the goal amount for a campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    In the graph, Outcomes Based on Launch Date, it shows how many successful, failed or canceled campaigns did in a certain month. It will also give us a general idea when the most successful campaings happened in a year, here we can see that there were more successful fundraising campaigns in May/June compared to Nov/Dec. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    The graph, Outcomes Based on Goals, it shows the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns compared to the goal amount the campaign wanted to raise. Here we can see that the lower the goal amount, the higher rate of successful campaigns. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
     One challenge I encountered was finding the correct COUNTIFS formula. There were quite a few attempts to make sure the formulas were not only grabbing the correct data but also had the correct range. It was a lot of trail and error. I would get one part of the formula right but the second part wrong. I kept going until I finally found the correct formula for getting the right information out of the dataset in order to find the correct information needed. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - Two conclusions I had about the Outcomes based on Launch Date was them most successful campaigns happened in the months May and June. While the least amount of successful campaigns happend in November and December. Another conclusion, was when there are more successful campaigns there is also a larger amount of failed campaigns.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - A conclusion I had about the Outcomes based on Goals, was there were more successful fundraising campaigns when the goal amount was between, less than $1000 and $9999. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - Some limitations of this dataset is, that it doesn't include different genres of the plays and that could be a factor in what gets funded and what does not. Another limation is that we're only looking at two variables, Launch Date and Goals, I think it would be better if there was a second variable to get a more specific idea on how fundirising does for plays. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - Other tables and graphs we could create would be how different campaigns did based on the country they were in, how many backers they had or how they did based on average donations. Another graph or table would have been how each fundrising did in a certain year and then compare each year to each other.
